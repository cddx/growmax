## üîå Relay Board Wiring

### Relay Assignments
```python
# Suggested relay assignments:
# Relay 1: Zone 1 irrigation (vegetable garden)
# Relay 2: Zone 2 irrigation (fruit trees)
# Relay 3: Zone 3 irrigation (flower beds)
# Relay 4: Zone 4 irrigation (drought-tolerant area)
# Relay 5: Zone 5 irrigation (herb garden)
# Relay 6: Zone 6 irrigation (shrubs)
# Relay 7: Zone 7 irrigation (specialty plants)
# Relay 8: Auto-refill motorized ball valve
```

### Power Supply Considerations
- **Relay Logic**: 3.3V from GrowMax board (via I2C)
- **Relay Coils**: May need 5V external supply
- **Controlled Equipment**: 12V/24V separate supply
- **Isolation**: Relays provide electrical isolation for safety

## üå± Hardware Setup

### 1. Relay Board Connection
1. **Connect I2C**: Use QWIIC connector to relay board
2. **Power relay board**: May need external 5V supply
3. **Set I2C address**: Check jumpers/switches on relay board

### 2. High-Power Equipment
1. **Solenoid Valves**: Connect to relay NO (Normally Open) contacts
2. **Motorized Ball Valve**: Connect to dedicated relay (Relay 8)
3. **Power Supplies**: Separate 12V/24V supply for valves
4. **Fusing**: Add appropriate fuses for each circuit

### 3. Display Setup
Choose your preferred activation method:

#### PIR Motion Sensor
- **Connection**: GPIO 15, 3.3V, GND
- **Placement**: Near display for easy activation
- **Sensitivity**: Adjust potentiometer as needed

#### Capacitive Touch Sensor
- **Connection**: GPIO 16, 3.3V, GND
- **Mounting**: Behind non-conductive surface
- **Sensitivity**: Adjustable via onboard controls

#### Physical Button
- **Connection**: GPIO 17, GND (with internal pull-up)
- **Type**: Momentary push button
- **Mounting**: Weatherproof enclosure recommended

### 4. Safety Systems
1. **Water Level Sensors**: Multiple sensors recommended
2. **Flow Meters**: Monitor actual water usage
3. **Manual Overrides**: Physical shutoff valves
4. **Overflow Protection**: Drainage and alarms

## üíß Auto-Refill System Setup

### Motorized Ball Valve Configuration
```python
# Auto-refill settings (USE WITH CAUTION)
AUTO_REFILL_RELAY_POSITION = 8    # Dedicated relay for ball valve
AUTO_REFILL_DURATION = 30         # Conservative duration

# Safety considerations:
# - Start with very short durations (10-15 seconds)
# - Monitor first several refill cycles
# - Install overflow protection
# - Consider flow meters for monitoring
# - Have manual shutoff readily accessible
```

### Safety Recommendations
1. **Start Conservative**: 10-15 second refill cycles initially
2. **Monitor Closely**: Watch first 10+ refill cycles
3. **Install Overflow**: Drainage and alarm systems
4. **Flow Monitoring**: Track actual water usage
5. **Manual Backup**: Always have manual shutoff available
6. **Insurance**: Check coverage for automated water systems

## üñ•Ô∏è Display Activation Options

### PIR Motion Sensor (Default)
```python
DISPLAY_SWITCH = 15
DISPLAY_SWITCH_CLASS = "MotionSensor"
DISPLAY_SWITCH_DURATION_MS = 20000  # 20 seconds
```
**Best for**: Outdoor installations, hands-free operation

### Capacitive Touch Sensor
```python
DISPLAY_SWITCH = 16
DISPLAY_SWITCH_CLASS = None
DISPLAY_SWITCH_DURATION_MS = 15000
DISPLAY_SWITCH_TRIGGER = machine.Pin.IRQ_RISING
```
**Best for**: Clean installations, weather protection

### Physical Button
```python
DISPLAY_SWITCH = 17
DISPLAY_SWITCH_CLASS = None
DISPLAY_SWITCH_PULL = machine.Pin.PULL_UP
DISPLAY_SWITCH_TRIGGER = machine.Pin.IRQ_FALLING
```
**Best for**: Reliable operation, simple interface

## üìä System Monitoring

### Real-Time Display
The OLED shows:
1. **Zone Status**: Which irrigation zones are active
2. **Moisture Levels**: All 8 sensor readings
3. **Relay Status**: Which relays are currently on
4. **Water Level**: Reservoir status
5. **Auto-Refill**: Last refill time and duration

### Cloud Monitoring
Track via opensensor.io:
- **Water usage** per zone
- **Irrigation frequency** and duration
- **System uptime** and reliability
- **Auto-refill activity** and volumes

## üîß Testing and Commissioning

### Initial Testing (No Water)
1. **Test relay activation**: Verify each relay switches
2. **Check display**: Ensure activation methods work
3. **Verify I2C communication**: All devices respond
4. **Test safety systems**: Water level sensors, overrides

### Water System Testing
1. **Manual valve testing**: Operate each zone manually
2. **Short cycle testing**: 5-10 second irrigation cycles
3. **Auto-refill testing**: Very short refill cycles (5 seconds)
4. **Monitor for leaks**: Check all connections

### Full System Commissioning
1. **Gradual duration increase**: Slowly increase cycle times
2. **Monitor plant response**: Adjust thresholds as needed
3. **Optimize scheduling**: Based on plant and weather data
4. **Document settings**: Record working configurations

## üö® Safety Protocols

### Daily Checks
- **Visual inspection** of all connections
- **Water level verification**
- **Check for leaks** or unusual operation

### Weekly Maintenance
- **Clean sensors** and connections
- **Test manual overrides**
- **Review usage data** for anomalies

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Water leak detected**: Immediate manual shutoff
2. **System malfunction**: Disconnect power, manual mode
